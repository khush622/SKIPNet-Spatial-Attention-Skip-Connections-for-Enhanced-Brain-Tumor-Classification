In medical image analysis, the ability to learn discriminative representation from images is essential. Attention mechanisms enable algorithms to deliver different levels of concentration 
to image regions, which has produced ground-breaking results in the field of computer vision. To identify type of tumor from MRIs of brain, in this research, we propose a novel architecture integrating 
traditional Conv-Nets with spatial attention mechanism to enhance the analysis of brain MRI images. The model uses spatial attention blocks leveraging dilated convolutions to capture and emphasize
relevant spatial features, facilitating the accurate classification of brain MRI scans into three distinct categories. The proposed approach demonstrated superior performance across various 
metrics, achieving 96.90% accuracy. The integration of spatial attention with the traditional Conv-Nets architecture resulted in improved contextual information aggregation, which was critical in 
identifying intricate patterns within the MRI images. Extensive experimentation and comparison with baseline models highlight the robustness and efficiency of our proposed architecture, marking a 
significant advancement in automated brain MRI image analysis.
