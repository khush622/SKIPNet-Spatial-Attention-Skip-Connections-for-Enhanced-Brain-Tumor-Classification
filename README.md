# SKIPNet-Spatial-Attention-Skip-Connections-for-Enhanced-Brain-Tumor-Classification
This project presents a robust deep learning framework for brain tumor classification using MRI images. By incorporating spatial attention as skip connections, the model achieves a remarkable accuracy of 96.9%.

# Key Features
High Accuracy: Achieved 96.9% classification accuracy.
Innovative Architecture: Utilized spatial attention mechanisms as skip connections to enhance feature extraction and information flow.
No data preprocessing was required by the model.

# Model Architecture
The model leverages convolutional neural network (CNN) with Spatial Attention added as Skip Connections for better feature extraction.
Dropouts were further utilised to apply regularization.
